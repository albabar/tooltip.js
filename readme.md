#Yet Another tooltip library made with pure javascript.

Just made this while practicing JS. It may not be perfect. And also don't talk with me about IE support.
My design look like shit, so if you're interested to extend the design, send me a pull request.


##How to.
Using it very simple.
Just include the JS file into the footer (before closing body tag) of your website. Also load the css file whereever you like.

Now create links with `title` attribute and you're done. This script will take care of the rest.

Checkout the included html file for example.
